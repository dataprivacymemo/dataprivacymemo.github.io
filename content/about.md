Hi, I'm David Friedman, an attorney working in data privacy law. With a background in consumer protection/financial services, I'm currently developing new expertise in the world of privacy. 

As part of this transition, I'm preparing for the CIPP/E (Certified Information Privacy Professional/Europe) certification to deepen my understanding of the GDPR and European data protection frameworks. This blog is where I share insights, learnings, and reflections from this process.

I split my time between New York and Valencia, Spain, which gives me a unique cross-cultural perspective on privacy issues. My goal is to make complex privacy concepts approachable and to explore the practical implications for both businesses and consumers.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow privacy enthusiasts, professionals, and anyone interested in learning more about data protection. Feel free to reach out:
