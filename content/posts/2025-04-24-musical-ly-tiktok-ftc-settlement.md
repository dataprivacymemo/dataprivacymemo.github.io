## The human story behind the case

Behind every playful dance video and lip-sync performance was a sinister machine harvesting the most vulnerable users' most personal information. Musical.ly—later rebranded as TikTok—didn't just create a social media platform; it built a surveillance engine targeting children as young as 13.

### Legal context

On February 27, 2019, the Federal Trade Commission delivered a landmark $5.7 million settlement, exposing the platform's systematic violation of children's online privacy rights.

## Key legal findings

### Specific COPPA violations
- Collecting personal information from children under 13
- Failing to obtain parental consent for data collection
- Allowing children to create public profiles by default
- Enabling direct messaging and location tracking for underage users
- Persistent tracking of user data across devices and platforms

## Financial implications
- **Total penalty**: $5.7 million
- Most significant COPPA enforcement action at the time
- Mandated comprehensive privacy reforms

## Technical nuances of exploitation

### Data collection mechanisms
- Frictionless account creation process
- Default public profile settings
- Sophisticated user tracking technologies
- Algorithmic content recommendation systems that prioritized engagement over protection

## Broader impact

### For social media platforms
- Mandatory age verification processes
- Stricter consent mechanisms
- Limitations on data collection for minors
- Increased transparency in user data handling

### For digital privacy
- Exposed the predatory design of social media platforms
- Highlighted the vulnerability of young internet users
- Demonstrated how engagement metrics override user protection

## Precedent and future implications
- Set a critical standard for protecting children's online privacy
- Forced platforms to reconsider default design choices
- Created increased scrutiny for social media companies targeting young audiences
- Exposed the monetization of children's digital interactions
