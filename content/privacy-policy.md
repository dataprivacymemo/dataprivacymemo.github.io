## Introduction

At Data Privacy Memo, transparency is fundamental. This privacy policy explains the limited ways in which I collect, use, and protect any information that relates to you when you visit dataprivacymemo.com. As a privacy professional, I've designed this website with data minimization as a core principle.

## Who I Am

Data Privacy Memo is operated by David Friedman, a data privacy lawyer operating between the U.S. and the E.U.. I can be contacted at david@dataprivacymemo.com for any privacy-related inquiries.

## Information I Collect

### Site Analytics

I use GoatCounter, a privacy-friendly analytics service, to collect anonymous information about website traffic. GoatCounter:

- Does not use cookies
- Does not collect or store personal data
- Collects only non-identifying, aggregate information such as:
  - Pages viewed
  - Referring websites
  - Browser types
  - Approximate geographic location (country level)
  - Time of visit

This information cannot reasonably be used to identify you as an individual. This ensures your digital footprint remains yours. The legal basis for this processing is my legitimate interest in understanding how visitors interact with my website to improve its content and functionality.

### Newsletter (Future)

If a newsletter is introduced:

- I will collect only your email address
- Your email address will be used solely for the purpose of sending you the newsletter
- I will rely on your consent as the legal basis for this processing
- You will be able to easily unsubscribe at any time

## How I Use Your Information

Anonymous analytics data serves one purpose: improving the website's value and user experience. No hidden agendas, no data monetization.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

I use the following third-party services:

- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the website
- **Proton Mail**: Email provider
- **GoatCounter**: Privacy-friendly analytics

I do not sell, rent, or otherwise share any information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## International Transfers

As I operate between the United States and Spain, website data may be processed in either country. Any future data storage will include comprehensive safeguards aligned with both GDPR and emerging global privacy standards.

## Data Retention

Any data collected will be retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, with a maximum retention period of 10 years.

## Your Rights

Under the GDPR and other applicable privacy laws, you have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to:

- Access information held about you
- Correct inaccurate information
- Request deletion of your information
- Restrict or object to processing
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)

To exercise any of these rights, please contact me at david@dataprivacymemo.com.

## Cookie Policy

This website does not use cookies.

## Children's Privacy

This website is not directed at children under 16, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

I may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in my practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. Significant changes will be prominently noted on the website.

## How to Contact Me
