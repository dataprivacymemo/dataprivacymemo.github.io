Recently I discovered &lt;a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org">Cover Your Tracks&lt;/a>, a free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that does something surprisingly simple yet powerful: it shows you exactly how trackable you are online.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this web tool does a deep dive into your browser&amp;rsquo;s unique fingerprint. Most people have no idea how much information their own browser leaks about their identity, location, and browsing habits. Cover Your Tracks reveals the digital breadcrumbs you&amp;rsquo;re leaving behind without even realizing it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Five Surprising Ways Data Privacy Impacts Real Life</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:39:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing to take the IAPP&amp;rsquo;s CIPP/E (European data privacy) certification, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to understand better just how data privacy shapes human experiences.

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Automated processing&amp;rdquo; is a trending issue under the GDPR. Article 22 allows people to opt out of decisions based solely on algorithms, where the decision would affect their lives significantly. Automated screening systems are now everywhere in the workplace&amp;ndash;they parse resumes, social media profiles, and online footprints.

What seemed like a theoretical discussion about algorithmic decision-making is actually a critical employment equity issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Consumer Finance to Data Privacy</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:39:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I started working as a fresh law school grad during the 2008 financial crisis in New York City, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I was laying the groundwork for a journey into data privacy.

&lt;p>For seventeen years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional translator of complexity. Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn&amp;rsquo;t just numbers or records. It&amp;rsquo;s the story of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
