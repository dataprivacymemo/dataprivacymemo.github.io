With a long background in consumer protection/financial services, I&amp;rsquo;m currently deepening my expertise in the world of privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing for the Certified Information Privacy Professional (Europe) certification to deepen my understanding of the GDPR and European data protection frameworks. This blog is where I share insights, learnings, and reflections from this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I split my time between New York and Valencia, Spain, which gives me a unique cross-cultural perspective on privacy issues. My goal is to make complex privacy concepts approachable and to explore the practical implications for both businesses and consumers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Privacy Tool Spotlight: EFF's Cover Your Tracks</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-09-privacy-tool-spotlight-cover/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-09-privacy-tool-spotlight-cover/</guid><description>This free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation reveals your digital fingerprint, showing exactly how trackable you are online and empowering you with practical strategies to protect your privacy.</description></item><item><title>Five Surprising Ways Data Privacy Impacts Real Life</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:39:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/</guid><description>From algorithmic job screening to hidden healthcare data ecosystems, these real-world scenarios transform abstract concepts into urgent human stories.</description></item><item><title>From Consumer Finance to Data Privacy</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:39:52 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/</guid><description>My seventeen-year journey from untangling predatory lending to exploring data privacy law revealed that data isn&amp;rsquo;t just numbers, but the story of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, their struggles, and their vulnerabilities.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://dataprivacymemo.com/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dataprivacymemo.com/privacy-policy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Last Updated: March 10, 2025&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
