Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn’t just numbers or records. It’s the story of people’s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act was particularly eye-opening for the work I’m doing now. I saw firsthand the real-world consequences of data mishandling–how a single error in a credit report could derail someone’s chance to buy a home, secure a job, or rebuild their financial life.

It wasn’t just about legal compliance; it was about protecting people’s fundamental ability to move forward in a complicated world.\nMy pivot to data protection law came from a simple, powerful realization: in our digital age, understanding and protecting personal data is about building trust.
