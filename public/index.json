[{"content":"The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) is about to shine a spotlight on one of the most complex and challenging aspects of data protection: the right to erasure. Last week they announced a Coordinated Enforcement Action on the right to be forgotten. For organizations operating in or serving European markets, this will probably call for some strategic preparation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that the Coordinated Enforcement Action will result in significantly more enforcement actions being launched by DPAs, we should expect that some of the trickier issues out there will be brought to light and tested.\nPrevious Coordinated Enforcement Actions focused on use of cloud-based services by the public sector, designation and position of data protection officers, and implementation of the right of access by controllers.\nBeyond the Basics: The Complexity of Erasing Data The right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) sounds straightforward, but it\u0026rsquo;s anything but simple. Organizations will need to navigate a minefield of technical, legal, and ethical considerations that go far beyond a simple delete button.\nFive Critical Fringe Cases to Watch 1. Conflicting Legal Obligations What happens when a right to erasure request conflicts with other legal requirements? Financial institutions, for example, must balance data protection requests with anti-money laundering regulations that mandate keeping certain records. Healthcare providers face similar challenges with medical record retention laws.\n2. Distributed Data Ecosystems The real challenge lies in data that\u0026rsquo;s been shared, copied, or integrated across multiple systems. How thoroughly must an organization track and eliminate personal data? This includes:\nThird-party databases Archived backups Shared cloud services Analytics and reporting systems 3. Partial Erasure and Pseudonymization The EDPB is likely to scrutinize nuanced approaches to data minimization. When is data truly \u0026ldquo;erased,\u0026rdquo; and when is it simply transformed? Organizations will need to demonstrate:\nMeaningful data reduction Effective pseudonymization techniques Clear documentation of erasure processes 4. Cross-Border and Multi-Platform Challenges International organizations face complex scenarios. A request from an EU citizen might involve:\nData stored on servers in multiple countries Different legal interpretations across jurisdictions Complex platform ecosystems (social media, cloud services, etc.) 5. Automated Systems and AI Training Data Perhaps the most cutting-edge challenge involves AI and machine learning systems. How do you \u0026ldquo;erase\u0026rdquo; someone from a trained algorithm? This raises critical questions about:\nRetraining machine learning models Removing individual data points from complex datasets Balancing individual rights with technological innovation Practical Implications for Organizations The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s coordinated action isn\u0026rsquo;t just about finding violations\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about establishing best practices. Organizations should prepare by:\nConducting comprehensive data mapping exercises Developing clear, transparent erasure procedures Creating cross-functional response teams Implementing robust tracking and verification mechanisms Preparing detailed documentation of erasure processes The Broader Context This enforcement action is part of a broader trend of increasing data protection scrutiny. The EDPB has previously investigated cloud services, data protection officers, and access rights. Each investigation has raised the bar for compliance, turning data protection from a legal checkbox into a strategic imperative.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake Non-compliance isn\u0026rsquo;t just about potential fines\u0026ndash;though those can be substantial. It\u0026rsquo;s about maintaining trust, protecting individual rights, and demonstrating technological and ethical sophistication in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-12-edpb-coordinated-enforcement/","summary":"The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s upcoming coordinated enforcement reveals critical challenges in implementing the right to be forgotten","title":"GDPR's Right to Erasure: What to Know About the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Action"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m David Friedman, an attorney working in data privacy law.

Recently I discovered Cover Your Tracks, a free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that does something surprisingly simple yet powerful: it shows you exactly how trackable you are online.\nWhat Is Cover Your Tracks? Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this web tool does a deep dive into your browser\u0026rsquo;s unique fingerprint.

As I dig deeper into my studies, five real-world scenarios straight from the headlines have helped me transform abstract legal concepts into urgent human stories.\n1. Job Hunting in the Algorithmic Age \u0026ldquo;Automated processing\u0026rdquo; is a trending issue under the GDPR. Article 22 allows people to opt out of decisions based solely on algorithms, where the decision would affect their lives significantly. Automated screening systems are now everywhere in the workplace\u0026ndash;they parse resumes, social media profiles, and online footprints. A single tagged photo, an old tweet, or a data broker\u0026rsquo;s profile can silently eliminate job candidates. What seemed like a theoretical discussion about algorithmic decision-making is actually a critical employment equity issue.\n2. Healthcare\u0026rsquo;s Hidden Data Ecosystem Health care data is treated as a special category of data under the GDPR and cannot be legally processed unless a narrow exception applies. This is because medical data can have profound consequences when used in decision-making. Insurance companies, employers, and marketers constantly try to seek health insights. That pregnancy test bought online, the mental health app, the genetic test taken out of curiosity\u0026ndash;each could create a digital trail with potential consequences far beyond a simple privacy breach.\n3. Financial Profiling: Beyond Traditional Credit Scores The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s principle of data minimization takes on new meaning in financial services. Banks and lenders now use expansive data collection to create comprehensive \u0026ldquo;financial profiles\u0026rdquo; that go far beyond traditional credit scores. Your online shopping patterns, social media activity, even the type of smartphone you use can now influence loan approvals, credit limits, and interest rates. What used to be discrete pieces of personal information have become a complex algorithmic assessment of your financial \u0026ldquo;trustworthiness.\u0026rdquo;\n4. Digital Safety and the Right to Erasure The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;right to be forgotten\u0026rdquo; becomes a critical safety mechanism in cases of digital abuse. Survivors of domestic violence can now legally demand the removal of personal data from platforms used for stalking. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about deleting old posts\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about preventing real-time location tracking, blocking access to communication logs, and giving individuals control over their digital footprint. The right to erasure becomes a powerful tool for protecting personal safety in an era of pervasive digital surveillance.\n5. The Algorithmic Filter Bubble Recommendation algorithms aren\u0026rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. They create echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs, limit exposure to diverse perspectives, and manipulate consumer behavior. My studies reveal how data processing can fundamentally shape individual perception and choice.\nStudying for CIPP/E has reminded me that data privacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding. It\u0026rsquo;s about control\u0026ndash;controlling the narrative of your own life in an increasingly algorithmic world.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/","summary":"From algorithmic job screening to hidden healthcare data ecosystems, these real-world scenarios transform abstract concepts into urgent human stories.","title":"Five Surprising Ways Data Privacy Impacts Real Life"},{"content":"When I started working as a fresh law school grad during the 2008 financial crisis in New York City, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was laying the groundwork for a journey into data privacy. My early work was about untangling complex financial concepts\u0026ndash;helping homeowners navigate predatory lending, understanding the intricate world of mortgage securitization, and breaking down seemingly impenetrable financial structures into something people could actually understand.\nFor seventeen years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a professional translator of complexity. Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers or records. It\u0026rsquo;s the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act was particularly eye-opening for the work I\u0026rsquo;m doing now. I saw firsthand the real-world consequences of data mishandling\u0026ndash;how a single error in a credit report could derail someone\u0026rsquo;s chance to buy a home, secure a job, or rebuild their financial life. I also saw how fragile trust levels could be between people and the companies who held increasingly more of their personal data. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about legal compliance; it was about protecting people\u0026rsquo;s fundamental ability to move forward in a complicated world.\nMy pivot to data protection law came from a simple, powerful realization: in our digital age, understanding and protecting personal data is about building trust. When businesses treat data with respect\u0026ndash;as a reflection of real human experiences\u0026ndash;they do more than comply with regulations, they bolster relationships.\nLiving between New York and Europe since 2022 exposed me to the GDPR, a privacy framework that, while criticized as overly burdensome by its opponents, is light-years ahead of U.S. approaches in protecting user data. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a set of rules; it\u0026rsquo;s a philosophy of data respect. I saw an opportunity to bridge worlds\u0026ndash;to help U.S. practitioners understand this nuanced, human-centric approach to data protection.\nThis blog is my attempt to demystify data privacy. It\u0026rsquo;s for the business leader wondering how to build customer trust, the professional navigating new privacy landscapes, and anyone curious about how data protection really protects people.\nLots more to come, stay tuned.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/","summary":"My seventeen-year journey from untangling predatory lending to exploring data privacy law revealed that data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers, but the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their struggles, and their vulnerabilities.","title":"From Consumer Finance to Data Privacy"},{"content":"Last Updated: March 10, 2025\nIntroduction At Data Privacy Memo, transparency is fundamental.

The once-stable EU-US Data Privacy Framework is showing signs of strain, with potential consequences that could reshape global digital interactions.\nThe Perfect Storm of Uncertainty Multiple recent developments are challenging the delicate balance of cross-border data transfers:\nExecutive Power and Regulatory Flexibility The US is signaling an expanded interpretation of executive authority over data policy. A recent declaration in the Federal Register by Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggests that \u0026ldquo;all efforts to control the transfer of data across US borders\u0026rdquo; could be considered a foreign affairs function. Translation? The executive branch might modify data transfer rules with minimal public input.\nInstitutional Independence Under Pressure The Federal Trade Commission\u0026rsquo;s recent shake-up adds another layer of complexity. The White House\u0026rsquo;s removal of Democratic commissioners, leaving the agency with a Republican majority, raises serious questions about the independence of privacy enforcement mechanisms. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework depends on the perception of independent, robust privacy enforcement. The American Economic Liberties Project has noted that the framework is \u0026ldquo;expressly predicated on the US having an independent, bipartisan FTC to enforce privacy protections without fear or favor.\u0026rdquo;\nEuropean Commissioner Michael McGrath remains cautiously optimistic, emphasizing a commitment to the Data Privacy Framework. However, the framework\u0026rsquo;s foundation\u0026ndash;independent and impartial review of data transfer mechanisms\u0026ndash;is increasingly fragile.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake This isn\u0026rsquo;t just bureaucratic reshuffling. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework facilitates over $1 trillion in annual trade. Its potential destabilization could have far-reaching consequences:\nIncreased legal uncertainty for multinational corporations Potential disruption of digital trade Heightened scrutiny of data transfer mechanisms Risk of localized data governance approaches The EU\u0026rsquo;s Delicate Balancing Act The EU is showing signs of adaptation. Hints of GDPR modifications, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggest a pragmatic approach. But the core challenge remains: How to maintain robust data protection while keeping international data flows smooth?\nKey Takeaways for Privacy Professionals Stay incredibly informed about policy shifts Build flexible, adaptable data governance frameworks Maintain transparent communication channels Prepare for potential rapid regulatory changes Uncertainty is the Only Constant The cross-border data transfer landscape in 2025 looks less like a clear highway and more like a winding, fog-covered mountain road.

The once-stable EU-US Data Privacy Framework is showing signs of strain, with potential consequences that could reshape global digital interactions.\nThe Perfect Storm of Uncertainty Multiple recent developments are challenging the delicate balance of cross-border data transfers:\nExecutive Power and Regulatory Flexibility The US is signaling an expanded interpretation of executive authority over data policy. A recent declaration in the Federal Register by Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggests that \u0026ldquo;all efforts to control the transfer of data across US borders\u0026rdquo; could be considered a foreign affairs function. Translation? The executive branch might modify data transfer rules with minimal public input.\nInstitutional Independence Under Pressure The Federal Trade Commission\u0026rsquo;s recent shake-up adds another layer of complexity. The White House\u0026rsquo;s removal of Democratic commissioners, leaving the agency with a Republican majority, raises serious questions about the independence of privacy enforcement mechanisms. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework depends on the perception of independent, robust privacy enforcement. The American Economic Liberties Project has noted that the framework is \u0026ldquo;expressly predicated on the US having an independent, bipartisan FTC to enforce privacy protections without fear or favor.\u0026rdquo;\nEuropean Commissioner Michael McGrath remains cautiously optimistic, emphasizing a commitment to the Data Privacy Framework. However, the framework\u0026rsquo;s foundation\u0026ndash;independent and impartial review of data transfer mechanisms\u0026ndash;is increasingly fragile.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake This isn\u0026rsquo;t just bureaucratic reshuffling. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework facilitates over $1 trillion in annual trade. Its potential destabilization could have far-reaching consequences:\nIncreased legal uncertainty for multinational corporations Potential disruption of digital trade Heightened scrutiny of data transfer mechanisms Risk of localized data governance approaches The EU\u0026rsquo;s Delicate Balancing Act The EU is showing signs of adaptation. Hints of GDPR modifications, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggest a pragmatic approach. But the core challenge remains: How to maintain robust data protection while keeping international data flows smooth?\nKey Takeaways for Privacy Professionals Stay incredibly informed about policy shifts Build flexible, adaptable data governance frameworks Maintain transparent communication channels Prepare for potential rapid regulatory changes Uncertainty is the Only Constant The cross-border data transfer landscape in 2025 looks less like a clear highway and more like a winding, fog-covered mountain road. Each turn brings new challenges, new perspectives, and new opportunities for creative problem-solving.\nFor businesses and privacy professionals, the message is clear: flexibility is not just an asset\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s a survival skill.\nSources and Further Reading To research this post, I relied on the following articles from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP):\n\u0026ldquo;European commissioner discusses EU-US Data Privacy Framework, potential GDPR reform\u0026rdquo; (14 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;A view from DC: Can cross-border data policy change at will?\u0026rdquo; (21 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;Removal of FTC commissioners fuels uncertainty\u0026rdquo; (19 March 2025) Visit the IAPP website for more breaking news on international data privacy law and cross-border transfers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-21-cross-border/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn trying to understand the nuanced world of data privacy, I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching a critical transformation unfold in international data policy.

Last week they announced a Coordinated Enforcement Action on the right to be forgotten. For organizations operating in or serving European markets, this will probably call for some strategic preparation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that the Coordinated Enforcement Action will result in significantly more enforcement actions being launched by DPAs, we should expect that some of the trickier issues out there will be brought to light and tested.\nPrevious Coordinated Enforcement Actions focused on use of cloud-based services by the public sector, designation and position of data protection officers, and implementation of the right of access by controllers.\nBeyond the Basics: The Complexity of Erasing Data The right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) sounds straightforward, but it\u0026rsquo;s anything but simple. Organizations will need to navigate a minefield of technical, legal, and ethical considerations that go far beyond a simple delete button.\nFive Critical Fringe Cases to Watch 1. Conflicting Legal Obligations What happens when a right to erasure request conflicts with other legal requirements? Financial institutions, for example, must balance data protection requests with anti-money laundering regulations that mandate keeping certain records. Healthcare providers face similar challenges with medical record retention laws.\n2. Distributed Data Ecosystems The real challenge lies in data that\u0026rsquo;s been shared, copied, or integrated across multiple systems. How thoroughly must an organization track and eliminate personal data? This includes:\nThird-party databases Archived backups Shared cloud services Analytics and reporting systems 3. Partial Erasure and Pseudonymization The EDPB is likely to scrutinize nuanced approaches to data minimization. When is data truly \u0026ldquo;erased,\u0026rdquo; and when is it simply transformed? Organizations will need to demonstrate:\nMeaningful data reduction Effective pseudonymization techniques Clear documentation of erasure processes 4. Cross-Border and Multi-Platform Challenges International organizations face complex scenarios. A request from an EU citizen might involve:\nData stored on servers in multiple countries Different legal interpretations across jurisdictions Complex platform ecosystems (social media, cloud services, etc.) 5. Automated Systems and AI Training Data Perhaps the most cutting-edge challenge involves AI and machine learning systems. How do you \u0026ldquo;erase\u0026rdquo; someone from a trained algorithm? This raises critical questions about:\nRetraining machine learning models Removing individual data points from complex datasets Balancing individual rights with technological innovation Practical Implications for Organizations The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s coordinated action isn\u0026rsquo;t just about finding violations\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about establishing best practices. Organizations should prepare by:\nConducting comprehensive data mapping exercises Developing clear, transparent erasure procedures Creating cross-functional response teams Implementing robust tracking and verification mechanisms Preparing detailed documentation of erasure processes The Broader Context This enforcement action is part of a broader trend of increasing data protection scrutiny. The EDPB has previously investigated cloud services, data protection officers, and access rights. Each investigation has raised the bar for compliance, turning data protection from a legal checkbox into a strategic imperative.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake Non-compliance isn\u0026rsquo;t just about potential fines\u0026ndash;though those can be substantial. It\u0026rsquo;s about maintaining trust, protecting individual rights, and demonstrating technological and ethical sophistication in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-12-edpb-coordinated-enforcement/","summary":"The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s upcoming coordinated enforcement reveals critical challenges in implementing the right to be forgotten","title":"GDPR's Right to Erasure: What to Know About the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Action"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m David Friedman, an attorney working in data privacy law.

Recently I discovered Cover Your Tracks, a free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that does something surprisingly simple yet powerful: it shows you exactly how trackable you are online.\nWhat Is Cover Your Tracks? Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this web tool does a deep dive into your browser\u0026rsquo;s unique fingerprint. Most people have no idea how much information their own browser leaks about their identity, location, and browsing habits. Cover Your Tracks reveals the digital breadcrumbs you\u0026rsquo;re leaving behind without even realizing it.\nHow It Works The process is straightforward:\nVisit the Cover Your Tracks website The tool runs a series of tests on your browser It generates a detailed report about your online trackability What You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn The tool reveals:\nJust how unique your browser configuration is What types of tracking techniques are embedded in the websites you visit The myriad ways advertisers and websites can identify you My first run was eye-opening. Turns out, my browser configuration is almost as unique as a fingerprint—-meaning websites could easily identify me even if I\u0026rsquo;m using incognito mode.\nFrom the EFF:\nA digital fingerprint is essentially a list of characteristics that are unique to a single user, their browser, and their particular hardware setup. This includes information the browser needs to send to access websites, like the location of the website the user is requesting. But it also includes a host of seemingly insignificant data (like screen resolution and installed fonts) gathered by tracking scripts. Tracking sites can stitch all the small pieces together to form a unique picture, or \u0026ldquo;fingerprint,\u0026rdquo; of your device.\nPractical Takeaways Cover Your Tracks isn\u0026rsquo;t just about scary revelations, it\u0026rsquo;s an educational tool that empowers users.

Last week they announced a Coordinated Enforcement Action on the right to be forgotten. For organizations operating in or serving European markets, this will probably call for some strategic preparation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that the Coordinated Enforcement Action will result in significantly more enforcement actions being launched by DPAs, we should expect that some of the trickier issues out there will be brought to light and tested.\nPrevious Coordinated Enforcement Actions focused on use of cloud-based services by the public sector, designation and position of data protection officers, and implementation of the right of access by controllers.\nBeyond the Basics: The Complexity of Erasing Data The right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) sounds straightforward, but it\u0026rsquo;s anything but simple. Organizations will need to navigate a minefield of technical, legal, and ethical considerations that go far beyond a simple delete button.\nFive Critical Fringe Cases to Watch 1. Conflicting Legal Obligations What happens when a right to erasure request conflicts with other legal requirements? Financial institutions, for example, must balance data protection requests with anti-money laundering regulations that mandate keeping certain records. Healthcare providers face similar challenges with medical record retention laws.\n2. Distributed Data Ecosystems The real challenge lies in data that\u0026rsquo;s been shared, copied, or integrated across multiple systems. How thoroughly must an organization track and eliminate personal data? This includes:\nThird-party databases Archived backups Shared cloud services Analytics and reporting systems 3. Partial Erasure and Pseudonymization The EDPB is likely to scrutinize nuanced approaches to data minimization. When is data truly \u0026ldquo;erased,\u0026rdquo; and when is it simply transformed? Organizations will need to demonstrate:\nMeaningful data reduction Effective pseudonymization techniques Clear documentation of erasure processes 4. Cross-Border and Multi-Platform Challenges International organizations face complex scenarios. A request from an EU citizen might involve:\nData stored on servers in multiple countries Different legal interpretations across jurisdictions Complex platform ecosystems (social media, cloud services, etc.) 5. Automated Systems and AI Training Data Perhaps the most cutting-edge challenge involves AI and machine learning systems. How do you \u0026ldquo;erase\u0026rdquo; someone from a trained algorithm? This raises critical questions about:\nRetraining machine learning models Removing individual data points from complex datasets Balancing individual rights with technological innovation Practical Implications for Organizations The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s coordinated action isn\u0026rsquo;t just about finding violations\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about establishing best practices. Organizations should prepare by:\nConducting comprehensive data mapping exercises Developing clear, transparent erasure procedures Creating cross-functional response teams Implementing robust tracking and verification mechanisms Preparing detailed documentation of erasure processes The Broader Context This enforcement action is part of a broader trend of increasing data protection scrutiny. The EDPB has previously investigated cloud services, data protection officers, and access rights. Each investigation has raised the bar for compliance, turning data protection from a legal checkbox into a strategic imperative.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake Non-compliance isn\u0026rsquo;t just about potential fines\u0026ndash;though those can be substantial. It\u0026rsquo;s about maintaining trust, protecting individual rights, and demonstrating technological and ethical sophistication in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-12-edpb-coordinated-enforcement/","summary":"The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s upcoming coordinated enforcement reveals critical challenges in implementing the right to be forgotten","title":"GDPR's Right to Erasure: What to Know About the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Action"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m David Friedman, an attorney working in data privacy law.

Recently I discovered Cover Your Tracks, a free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that does something surprisingly simple yet powerful: it shows you exactly how trackable you are online.\nWhat Is Cover Your Tracks? Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this web tool does a deep dive into your browser\u0026rsquo;s unique fingerprint. Most people have no idea how much information their own browser leaks about their identity, location, and browsing habits. Cover Your Tracks reveals the digital breadcrumbs you\u0026rsquo;re leaving behind without even realizing it.\nHow It Works The process is straightforward:\nVisit the Cover Your Tracks website The tool runs a series of tests on your browser It generates a detailed report about your online trackability What You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn The tool reveals:\nJust how unique your browser configuration is What types of tracking techniques are embedded in the websites you visit The myriad ways advertisers and websites can identify you My first run was eye-opening. Turns out, my browser configuration is almost as unique as a fingerprint—-meaning websites could easily identify me even if I\u0026rsquo;m using incognito mode.\nFrom the EFF:\nA digital fingerprint is essentially a list of characteristics that are unique to a single user, their browser, and their particular hardware setup. This includes information the browser needs to send to access websites, like the location of the website the user is requesting. But it also includes a host of seemingly insignificant data (like screen resolution and installed fonts) gathered by tracking scripts. Tracking sites can stitch all the small pieces together to form a unique picture, or \u0026ldquo;fingerprint,\u0026rdquo; of your device.\nPractical Takeaways Cover Your Tracks isn\u0026rsquo;t just about scary revelations, it\u0026rsquo;s an educational tool that empowers users. After running the test, you get recommendations for:\nBrowser extensions that enhance privacy Settings changes to reduce trackability (mostly impossible as they explain, since the more you try to protect yourself the more you stand out) How you can become slightly more anonymous when you surf the web A Note of Perspective As I\u0026rsquo;m studying for the CIPP/E certification, I\u0026rsquo;m trying hard to discover how real-life strategies bridge the gap between legal frameworks and everyday privacy. Data privacy law talks about data protection principles, but Cover Your Tracks shows what those principles look like in practice.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-09-privacy-tool-spotlight-cover/","summary":"This free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation reveals your digital fingerprint, showing exactly how trackable you are online and empowering you with practical strategies to protect your privacy.","title":"Privacy Tool Spotlight: EFF's Cover Your Tracks"},{"content":"As I\u0026rsquo;ve been preparing to take the IAPP\u0026rsquo;s CIPP/E (European data privacy) certification, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to understand better just how data privacy shapes human experiences. As I dig deeper into my studies, five real-world scenarios straight from the headlines have helped me transform abstract legal concepts into urgent human stories.\n1. Job Hunting in the Algorithmic Age \u0026ldquo;Automated processing\u0026rdquo; is a trending issue under the GDPR. Article 22 allows people to opt out of decisions based solely on algorithms, where the decision would affect their lives significantly. Automated screening systems are now everywhere in the workplace\u0026ndash;they parse resumes, social media profiles, and online footprints. A single tagged photo, an old tweet, or a data broker\u0026rsquo;s profile can silently eliminate job candidates. What seemed like a theoretical discussion about algorithmic decision-making is actually a critical employment equity issue.\n2. Healthcare\u0026rsquo;s Hidden Data Ecosystem Health care data is treated as a special category of data under the GDPR and cannot be legally processed unless a narrow exception applies. This is because medical data can have profound consequences when used in decision-making. Insurance companies, employers, and marketers constantly try to seek health insights. That pregnancy test bought online, the mental health app, the genetic test taken out of curiosity\u0026ndash;each could create a digital trail with potential consequences far beyond a simple privacy breach.\n3. Financial Profiling: Beyond Traditional Credit Scores The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s principle of data minimization takes on new meaning in financial services. Banks and lenders now use expansive data collection to create comprehensive \u0026ldquo;financial profiles\u0026rdquo; that go far beyond traditional credit scores. Your online shopping patterns, social media activity, even the type of smartphone you use can now influence loan approvals, credit limits, and interest rates. What used to be discrete pieces of personal information have become a complex algorithmic assessment of your financial \u0026ldquo;trustworthiness.\u0026rdquo;\n4. Digital Safety and the Right to Erasure The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;right to be forgotten\u0026rdquo; becomes a critical safety mechanism in cases of digital abuse. Survivors of domestic violence can now legally demand the removal of personal data from platforms used for stalking. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about deleting old posts\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about preventing real-time location tracking, blocking access to communication logs, and giving individuals control over their digital footprint. The right to erasure becomes a powerful tool for protecting personal safety in an era of pervasive digital surveillance.\n5. The Algorithmic Filter Bubble Recommendation algorithms aren\u0026rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. They create echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs, limit exposure to diverse perspectives, and manipulate consumer behavior. My studies reveal how data processing can fundamentally shape individual perception and choice.\nStudying for CIPP/E has reminded me that data privacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding. It\u0026rsquo;s about control\u0026ndash;controlling the narrative of your own life in an increasingly algorithmic world.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/","summary":"From algorithmic job screening to hidden healthcare data ecosystems, these real-world scenarios transform abstract concepts into urgent human stories.","title":"Five Surprising Ways Data Privacy Impacts Real Life"},{"content":"When I started working as a fresh law school grad during the 2008 financial crisis in New York City, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was laying the groundwork for a journey into data privacy. My early work was about untangling complex financial concepts\u0026ndash;helping homeowners navigate predatory lending, understanding the intricate world of mortgage securitization, and breaking down seemingly impenetrable financial structures into something people could actually understand.\nFor seventeen years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a professional translator of complexity. Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers or records. It\u0026rsquo;s the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act was particularly eye-opening for the work I\u0026rsquo;m doing now. I saw firsthand the real-world consequences of data mishandling\u0026ndash;how a single error in a credit report could derail someone\u0026rsquo;s chance to buy a home, secure a job, or rebuild their financial life. I also saw how fragile trust levels could be between people and the companies who held increasingly more of their personal data. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about legal compliance; it was about protecting people\u0026rsquo;s fundamental ability to move forward in a complicated world.\nMy pivot to data protection law came from a simple, powerful realization: in our digital age, understanding and protecting personal data is about building trust. When businesses treat data with respect\u0026ndash;as a reflection of real human experiences\u0026ndash;they do more than comply with regulations, they bolster relationships.\nLiving between New York and Europe since 2022 exposed me to the GDPR, a privacy framework that, while criticized as overly burdensome by its opponents, is light-years ahead of U.S. approaches in protecting user data. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a set of rules; it\u0026rsquo;s a philosophy of data respect. I saw an opportunity to bridge worlds\u0026ndash;to help U.S. practitioners understand this nuanced, human-centric approach to data protection.\nThis blog is my attempt to demystify data privacy. It\u0026rsquo;s for the business leader wondering how to build customer trust, the professional navigating new privacy landscapes, and anyone curious about how data protection really protects people.\nLots more to come, stay tuned.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/","summary":"My seventeen-year journey from untangling predatory lending to exploring data privacy law revealed that data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers, but the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their struggles, and their vulnerabilities.","title":"From Consumer Finance to Data Privacy"},{"content":"Last Updated: March 10, 2025\nIntroduction At Data Privacy Memo, transparency is fundamental.

As I dig deeper into my studies, five real-world scenarios straight from the headlines have helped me transform abstract legal concepts into urgent human stories.\n1. Job Hunting in the Algorithmic Age \u0026ldquo;Automated processing\u0026rdquo; is a trending issue under the GDPR. Article 22 allows people to opt out of decisions based solely on algorithms, where the decision would affect their lives significantly. Automated screening systems are now everywhere in the workplace\u0026ndash;they parse resumes, social media profiles, and online footprints. A single tagged photo, an old tweet, or a data broker\u0026rsquo;s profile can silently eliminate job candidates. What seemed like a theoretical discussion about algorithmic decision-making is actually a critical employment equity issue.\n2. Healthcare\u0026rsquo;s Hidden Data Ecosystem Health care data is treated as a special category of data under the GDPR and cannot be legally processed unless a narrow exception applies. This is because medical data can have profound consequences when used in decision-making. Insurance companies, employers, and marketers constantly try to seek health insights. That pregnancy test bought online, the mental health app, the genetic test taken out of curiosity\u0026ndash;each could create a digital trail with potential consequences far beyond a simple privacy breach.\n3. Financial Profiling: Beyond Traditional Credit Scores The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s principle of data minimization takes on new meaning in financial services. Banks and lenders now use expansive data collection to create comprehensive \u0026ldquo;financial profiles\u0026rdquo; that go far beyond traditional credit scores. Your online shopping patterns, social media activity, even the type of smartphone you use can now influence loan approvals, credit limits, and interest rates. What used to be discrete pieces of personal information have become a complex algorithmic assessment of your financial \u0026ldquo;trustworthiness.\u0026rdquo;\n4. Digital Safety and the Right to Erasure The GDPR\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;right to be forgotten\u0026rdquo; becomes a critical safety mechanism in cases of digital abuse. Survivors of domestic violence can now legally demand the removal of personal data from platforms used for stalking. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about deleting old posts\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about preventing real-time location tracking, blocking access to communication logs, and giving individuals control over their digital footprint. The right to erasure becomes a powerful tool for protecting personal safety in an era of pervasive digital surveillance.\n5. The Algorithmic Filter Bubble Recommendation algorithms aren\u0026rsquo;t just a technical curiosity. They create echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs, limit exposure to diverse perspectives, and manipulate consumer behavior. My studies reveal how data processing can fundamentally shape individual perception and choice.\nStudying for CIPP/E has reminded me that data privacy isn\u0026rsquo;t about hiding. It\u0026rsquo;s about control\u0026ndash;controlling the narrative of your own life in an increasingly algorithmic world.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-05-five-ways/","summary":"From algorithmic job screening to hidden healthcare data ecosystems, these real-world scenarios transform abstract concepts into urgent human stories.","title":"Five Surprising Ways Data Privacy Impacts Real Life"},{"content":"When I started working as a fresh law school grad during the 2008 financial crisis in New York City, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was laying the groundwork for a journey into data privacy. My early work was about untangling complex financial concepts\u0026ndash;helping homeowners navigate predatory lending, understanding the intricate world of mortgage securitization, and breaking down seemingly impenetrable financial structures into something people could actually understand.\nFor seventeen years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a professional translator of complexity. Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers or records. It\u0026rsquo;s the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act was particularly eye-opening for the work I\u0026rsquo;m doing now. I saw firsthand the real-world consequences of data mishandling\u0026ndash;how a single error in a credit report could derail someone\u0026rsquo;s chance to buy a home, secure a job, or rebuild their financial life. I also saw how fragile trust levels could be between people and the companies who held increasingly more of their personal data. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about legal compliance; it was about protecting people\u0026rsquo;s fundamental ability to move forward in a complicated world.\nMy pivot to data protection law came from a simple, powerful realization: in our digital age, understanding and protecting personal data is about building trust. When businesses treat data with respect\u0026ndash;as a reflection of real human experiences\u0026ndash;they do more than comply with regulations, they bolster relationships.\nLiving between New York and Europe since 2022 exposed me to the GDPR, a privacy framework that, while criticized as overly burdensome by its opponents, is light-years ahead of U.S. approaches in protecting user data. It\u0026rsquo;s not just a set of rules; it\u0026rsquo;s a philosophy of data respect. I saw an opportunity to bridge worlds\u0026ndash;to help U.S. practitioners understand this nuanced, human-centric approach to data protection.\nThis blog is my attempt to demystify data privacy. It\u0026rsquo;s for the business leader wondering how to build customer trust, the professional navigating new privacy landscapes, and anyone curious about how data protection really protects people.\nLots more to come, stay tuned.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-03-from-consumer-protection-to-data-privacy/","summary":"My seventeen-year journey from untangling predatory lending to exploring data privacy law revealed that data isn\u0026rsquo;t just numbers, but the story of people\u0026rsquo;s lives, their struggles, and their vulnerabilities.","title":"From Consumer Finance to Data Privacy"},{"content":"Last Updated: March 10, 2025\nIntroduction At Data Privacy Memo, transparency is fundamental.

The once-stable(ish) EU-US Data Privacy Framework is showing signs of strain as the U.S. executive branch flexes more power.\nThe Perfect Storm of Uncertainty A few recent developments are challenging the delicate balance of cross-border data transfers:\nExecutive Power and Regulatory Flexibility The US is signaling an expanded interpretation of executive authority over data policy. A recent declaration in the Federal Register by Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggests that \u0026ldquo;all efforts to control the transfer of data across US borders\u0026rdquo; could be considered a foreign affairs function. Translation? The executive branch might modify data transfer rules with minimal public input.\nInstitutional Independence Under Pressure The Federal Trade Commission\u0026rsquo;s recent shake-up adds another layer of complexity. The White House\u0026rsquo;s illegal removal of Democratic commissioners, leaving the agency with only Republican members, raises serious questions about the independence of privacy enforcement mechanisms. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework depends on the perception of independent, robust privacy enforcement. The American Economic Liberties Project has noted that the framework is \u0026ldquo;expressly predicated on the US having an independent, bipartisan FTC to enforce privacy protections without fear or favor.\u0026rdquo;\nEuropean Commissioner Michael McGrath seems cautiously optimistic, emphasizing a commitment to the Data Privacy Framework. However, the framework\u0026rsquo;s foundation\u0026ndash;independent and impartial review of data transfer mechanisms\u0026ndash;is increasingly fragile.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake This isn\u0026rsquo;t just bureaucratic reshuffling. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework facilitates over $1 trillion in annual trade. Its potential destabilization could have far-reaching consequences, including increased legal uncertainty for multinational corporations and potential disruption of digital trade.\nThe EU\u0026rsquo;s Balancing Act The EU is showing signs of adaptation. Hints of GDPR modifications, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggest a pragmatic approach. But the core challenge remains: How to maintain robust data protection while keeping international data flows smooth?\nKey Takeaways for Privacy Professionals Stay incredibly informed about policy shifts Build flexible, adaptable data governance frameworks Prepare for rapid regulatory changes Uncertainty is the Only Constant The cross-border data transfer landscape in 2025 looks less like a stretch of clear highway and more like a winding, fog-covered mountain road. Each turn brings new challenges, new perspectives, and new opportunities for creative problem-solving.\nFor businesses and privacy professionals, the message is clear: flexibility isn\u0026rsquo;t just an asset\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s a survival skill.\nSources and Further Reading To research this post, I relied on the following articles from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP):\n\u0026ldquo;European commissioner discusses EU-US Data Privacy Framework, potential GDPR reform\u0026rdquo; (14 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;A view from DC: Can cross-border data policy change at will?\u0026rdquo; (21 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;Removal of FTC commissioners fuels uncertainty\u0026rdquo; (19 March 2025) Visit the IAPP website for more breaking news on international data privacy law and cross-border transfers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-21-cross-border/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn trying to understand the nuanced world of data privacy, I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching a critical transformation unfold in international data policy.

The once-stable(ish) EU-US Data Privacy Framework is showing signs of strain as the U.S. executive branch flexes more power.\nThe Perfect Storm of Uncertainty A few recent developments are challenging the delicate balance of cross-border data transfers:\nExecutive Power and Regulatory Flexibility The US is signaling an expanded interpretation of executive authority over data policy. A recent declaration in the Federal Register by Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggests that \u0026ldquo;all efforts to control the transfer of data across US borders\u0026rdquo; could be considered a foreign affairs function. Translation? The executive branch might modify data transfer rules with minimal public input.\nInstitutional Independence Under Pressure The Federal Trade Commission\u0026rsquo;s recent shake-up adds another layer of complexity. The White House\u0026rsquo;s illegal removal of Democratic commissioners, leaving the agency with only Republican members, raises serious questions about the independence of privacy enforcement mechanisms. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework depends on the perception of independent, robust privacy enforcement. The American Economic Liberties Project has noted that the framework is \u0026ldquo;expressly predicated on the US having an independent, bipartisan FTC to enforce privacy protections without fear or favor.\u0026rdquo;\nEuropean Commissioner Michael McGrath seems cautiously optimistic, emphasizing a commitment to the Data Privacy Framework. However, the framework\u0026rsquo;s foundation\u0026ndash;independent and impartial review of data transfer mechanisms\u0026ndash;is increasingly fragile.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake This isn\u0026rsquo;t just bureaucratic reshuffling. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework facilitates over $1 trillion in annual trade. Its potential destabilization could have far-reaching consequences, including increased legal uncertainty for multinational corporations and potential disruption of digital trade.\nThe EU\u0026rsquo;s Balancing Act The EU is showing signs of adaptation. Hints of GDPR modifications, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggest a pragmatic approach. But the core challenge remains: How to maintain robust data protection while keeping international data flows smooth?\nKey Takeaways for Privacy Professionals Stay incredibly informed about policy shifts Build flexible, adaptable data governance frameworks Prepare for rapid regulatory changes Uncertainty is the Only Constant The cross-border data transfer landscape in 2025 looks less like a stretch of clear highway and more like a winding, fog-covered mountain road. Each turn brings new challenges, new perspectives, and new opportunities for creative problem-solving.\nFor businesses and privacy professionals, the message is clear: flexibility isn\u0026rsquo;t just an asset\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s a survival skill.\nSources and Further Reading To research this post, I relied on the following articles from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP):\n\u0026ldquo;European commissioner discusses EU-US Data Privacy Framework, potential GDPR reform\u0026rdquo; (14 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;A view from DC: Can cross-border data policy change at will?\u0026rdquo; (21 March 2025) \u0026ldquo;Removal of FTC commissioners fuels uncertainty\u0026rdquo; (19 March 2025) Visit the IAPP website for more breaking news on international data privacy law and cross-border transfers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-21-cross-border/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn trying to understand the nuanced world of data privacy, I\u0026rsquo;ve been watching a critical transformation unfold in international data policy.

Last week they announced a Coordinated Enforcement Action on the right to be forgotten. For organizations operating in or serving European markets, this will probably call for some strategic preparation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that the Coordinated Enforcement Action will result in significantly more enforcement actions being launched by DPAs, we should expect that some of the trickier issues out there will be brought to light and tested.\nPrevious Coordinated Enforcement Actions focused on use of cloud-based services by the public sector, designation and position of data protection officers, and implementation of the right of access by controllers.\nBeyond the Basics: The Complexity of Erasing Data The right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) sounds straightforward, but it\u0026rsquo;s anything but simple. Organizations will need to navigate a minefield of technical, legal, and ethical considerations that go far beyond a simple delete button.\nFive Critical Fringe Cases to Watch 1. Conflicting Legal Obligations What happens when a right to erasure request conflicts with other legal requirements? Financial institutions, for example, must balance data protection requests with anti-money laundering regulations that mandate keeping certain records. Healthcare providers face similar challenges with medical record retention laws.\n2. Distributed Data Ecosystems The real challenge lies in data that\u0026rsquo;s been shared, copied, or integrated across multiple systems. How thoroughly must an organization track and eliminate personal data? This includes:\nThird-party databases Archived backups Shared cloud services Analytics and reporting systems 3. Partial Erasure and Pseudonymization The EDPB is likely to scrutinize nuanced approaches to data minimization. When is data truly \u0026ldquo;erased,\u0026rdquo; and when is it simply transformed? Organizations will need to demonstrate:\nMeaningful data reduction Effective pseudonymization techniques Clear documentation of erasure processes 4. Cross-Border and Multi-Platform Challenges International organizations face complex scenarios. A request from an EU citizen might involve:\nData stored on servers in multiple countries Different legal interpretations across jurisdictions Complex platform ecosystems (social media, cloud services, etc.) 5. Automated Systems and AI Training Data Perhaps the most cutting-edge challenge involves AI and machine learning systems. How do you \u0026ldquo;erase\u0026rdquo; someone from a trained algorithm? This raises critical questions about:\nRetraining machine learning models Removing individual data points from complex datasets Balancing individual rights with technological innovation Practical Implications for Organizations The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s coordinated action isn\u0026rsquo;t just about finding violations\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s about establishing best practices. Organizations should prepare by:\nConducting comprehensive data mapping exercises Developing clear, transparent erasure procedures Creating cross-functional response teams Implementing robust tracking and verification mechanisms Preparing detailed documentation of erasure processes The Broader Context This enforcement action is part of a broader trend of increasing data protection scrutiny. The EDPB has previously investigated cloud services, data protection officers, and access rights. Each investigation has raised the bar for compliance, turning data protection from a legal checkbox into a strategic imperative.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s at Stake Non-compliance isn\u0026rsquo;t just about potential fines\u0026ndash;though those can be substantial. It\u0026rsquo;s about maintaining trust, protecting individual rights, and demonstrating technological and ethical sophistication in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-03-12-edpb-coordinated-enforcement/","summary":"The EDPB\u0026rsquo;s upcoming coordinated enforcement reveals critical challenges in implementing the right to be forgotten","title":"GDPR's Right to Erasure: What to Know About the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Action"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m David Friedman, an attorney working in data privacy law.

Recently I discovered Cover Your Tracks, a free tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that does something surprisingly simple yet powerful: it shows you exactly how trackable you are online.\nWhat Is Cover Your Tracks? Developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this web tool does a deep dive into your browser\u0026rsquo;s unique fingerprint. Most people have no idea how much information their own browser leaks about their identity, location, and browsing habits. Cover Your Tracks reveals the digital breadcrumbs you\u0026rsquo;re leaving behind without even realizing it.\nHow It Works The process is straightforward:\nVisit the Cover Your Tracks website The tool runs a series of tests on your browser It generates a detailed report about your online trackability What You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn The tool reveals:\nJust how unique your browser configuration is What types of tracking techniques are embedded in the websites you visit The myriad ways advertisers and websites can identify you My first run was eye-opening. Turns out, my browser configuration is almost as unique as a fingerprint—-meaning websites could easily identify me even if I\u0026rsquo;m using incognito mode.\nFrom the EFF:\nA digital fingerprint is essentially a list of characteristics that are unique to a single user, their browser, and their particular hardware setup. This includes information the browser needs to send to access websites, like the location of the website the user is requesting. But it also includes a host of seemingly insignificant data (like screen resolution and installed fonts) gathered by tracking scripts. Tracking sites can stitch all the small pieces together to form a unique picture, or \u0026ldquo;fingerprint,\u0026rdquo; of your device.\nPractical Takeaways Cover Your Tracks isn\u0026rsquo;t just about scary revelations, it\u0026rsquo;s an educational tool that empowers users. After running the test, you get recommendations for:\nBrowser extensions that enhance privacy Settings changes to reduce trackability (mostly impossible as they explain, since the more you try to protect yourself the more you stand out) How you can become slightly more anonymous when you surf the web A Note of Perspective As I\u0026rsquo;m studying for the CIPP/E certification, I\u0026rsquo;m trying hard to discover how real-life strategies bridge the gap between legal frameworks and everyday privacy.
