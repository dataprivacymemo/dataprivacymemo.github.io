      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started working as a fresh law school grad during the 2008 financial crisis in New York City, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I was laying the groundwork for a journey into data privacy. My early work was about untangling complex financial concepts&amp;ndash;helping homeowners navigate predatory lending, understanding the intricate world of mortgage securitization, and breaking down seemingly impenetrable financial structures into something people could actually understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For seventeen years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional translator of complexity. Whether working through consumer bankruptcy issues or diving deep into the Fair Credit Reporting Act, my job was always about making the complicated comprehensible. I learned something crucial during those years: data isn&amp;rsquo;t just numbers or records. It&amp;rsquo;s the story of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, their financial struggles, their hopes, and their vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
